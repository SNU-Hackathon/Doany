# Firebase Migration - Edge Detection

**Date**: 2025-10-09  
**Status**: ✅ Firebase SDK completely removed

## Summary

All Firebase imports have been successfully removed from the codebase (excluding `src/legacy/firebase/`).

## Firebase Import Scan Results

### Direct Firebase Imports
```bash
grep -r "from ['\"]firebase" src/ --exclude-dir=legacy
# Result: 0 matches
```

✅ **Zero direct Firebase imports found outside legacy folder**

## Firebase SDK Function Usage

Files that contain Firebase SDK function names (but not necessarily using Firebase):

1. **src/hooks/useAuth.tsx** - New REST API auth hook (no Firebase)
2. **src/lib/http.ts** - HTTP client (no Firebase)  
3. **src/lib/token.ts** - Token resolver (no Firebase)
4. **src/services/ai.ts** - AI service (may reference Firebase in comments/types)
5. **src/state/auth.store.ts** - Auth store (no Firebase)
6. **src/types/chatbot.ts** - Type definitions only
7. **src/types/feed.ts** - Type definitions only
8. **src/utils/promptSecurity.ts** - Security utils (no Firebase)

**Note**: These files contain function names like `getAuth`, `doc`, etc., but they are either:
- Part of our new REST API implementation
- Type definitions
- Comment references
- Unrelated functions with similar names

## Legacy Firebase Code

All Firebase code has been moved to:
```
src/legacy/firebase/
├── services/     # 11 Firebase services
├── types/        # 2 Firebase types
├── utils/        # 1 Firebase utility
├── hooks/        # 1 Firebase hook
└── tests/        # 4 Firebase tests
```

## Stub Services Created

To prevent compilation errors during migration:
```
src/services/
├── goalService.ts          # Stub with TODO
├── questService.ts         # Stub with TODO  
├── calendarEventService.ts # Stub with TODO
└── feedService.ts          # Stub with TODO
```

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Firebase SDK removed
2. ⏭️ Create compat adapters to replace stubs
3. ⏭️ Update components to use compat adapters
4. ⏭️ Remove stub services
5. ⏭️ Archive legacy folder

---

**Conclusion**: Firebase has been successfully isolated and removed. The app now uses REST API v1.3 with mock support.
