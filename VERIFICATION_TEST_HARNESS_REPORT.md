# Verification Test Harness Implementation Report

## Summary
Successfully implemented a comprehensive test harness to verify that AI-generated `GoalSpec` objects persist correctly and are consumed by verification rules. All tests are passing (94/94).

## Components Implemented

### 1. Mock Firestore Implementation
- **File**: `src/services/__tests__/verificationTestHarness.test.ts`
- **Features**:
  - In-memory mock Firestore adapter
  - Simulates document storage and retrieval
  - Handles user/uid and goal/id document paths
  - Supports batch operations

### 2. Sample Goal Specifications
- **6 GoalSpecs covering all types**:
  - 2 Schedule goals (time+location, time+photo)
  - 2 Frequency goals (manual+location, manual+photo)
  - 2 Partner goals (required, optional)

### 3. GoalSpec to GoalDoc Conversion
- **Function**: `goalSpecToGoalDoc()`
- **Features**:
  - Converts AI-generated GoalSpec to Firestore GoalDoc format
  - Maps partner type to frequency for storage compatibility
  - Preserves verification methods from AI output
  - Maintains all required Firestore fields

### 4. Verification Rules Engine Testing
- **Scenarios Tested**:
  - On-time events at correct location (PASS)
  - Late events outside time window (FAIL)
  - Wrong location events (FAIL)
  - Photo validation (freshness, time validity)
  - Manual verification combinations

### 5. Policy Alignment Analysis
- **File**: `src/constants/verificationPolicies.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Single source of truth for verification policies
  - AI prompt policy mapping
  - Verification rules mapping
  - Gap detection between policies and implementation

### 6. Enhanced Verification Rules
- **File**: `src/services/verificationRules.ts`
- **Improvements**:
  - Added time window validation using `withinWindow()`
  - Enhanced location validation (checking `inside` property)
  - Support for time+location verification (in addition to manual+location and time+photo)
  - Consistent validation across schedule and frequency rules

## Test Results

### Test Coverage
- **Total Tests**: 94
- **Passing**: 94 (100%)
- **Test Files**: 4
  - Korean parsing utilities: 35 tests
  - Verification policies: 21 tests
  - GoalSpec schema: 24 tests
  - Verification test harness: 14 tests

### Key Test Scenarios
1. **GoalSpec Persistence**: Verifies correct storage format and derived fields
2. **Schedule Rule Validation**: Time windows, location correctness, photo validation
3. **Frequency Rule Validation**: Manual verification with location/photo
4. **Partner Goal Handling**: Proper mapping to frequency type for evaluation
5. **End-to-End Flow**: Complete GoalSpec → Storage → Verification pipeline

## Policy Gaps Identified

### Current Gap
- **Schedule Goal 1**: AI prompt suggests `time+location` verification, but original rule only supported `manual+location` or `time+photo`
- **Resolution**: Enhanced verification rules to support `time+location` verification

### Remaining Gap
- **Partner Verification Rule**: Not implemented in `verificationRules.ts`
- **Recommendation**: Implement `evalPartnerRule` function for partner-specific verification logic

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `src/services/__tests__/verificationTestHarness.test.ts` - Main test harness
- `src/constants/verificationPolicies.ts` - Policy definitions and alignment checker
- `src/constants/__tests__/verificationPolicies.test.ts` - Policy tests

### Modified Files
- `src/services/verificationRules.ts` - Enhanced with time window and location validation

## Recommendations

1. **Implement Partner Verification Rule**: Add `evalPartnerRule()` function to handle partner-specific verification logic
2. **Add Integration Tests**: Test with real Firestore in development environment
3. **Performance Testing**: Test with larger datasets and concurrent operations
4. **Error Handling**: Add more robust error handling for edge cases

## Conclusion

The verification test harness successfully validates the end-to-end flow from AI-generated GoalSpec objects through storage to verification rule evaluation. All critical paths are tested and working correctly, providing confidence in the system's reliability and correctness.
